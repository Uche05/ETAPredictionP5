# Food Delivery Time Prediction: Case Study


# Business Problem:

# Data Collection:



# Data Preprocessing:

# Model Selection:

# Model Training and Evaluation:

# Model Tuning:
The company performs hyperparameter tuning to optimize the selected model's performance. This involves using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

# Model Deployment:


# Monitoring and Maintenance:
After deployment, the model's performance is continuously monitored. If the model's accuracy decreases or if there are any issues with the prediction, the team investigates and updates the model accordingly. Regular maintenance and updates are performed to keep the model relevant and accurate as new data becomes available.

# Conclusion:
By implementing the food delivery time prediction model, the food delivery company can provide customers with more accurate delivery time estimates, reduce delivery delays, and improve overall customer satisfaction. Additionally, optimized delivery times can lead to cost savings and increased efficiency in the delivery operations.
